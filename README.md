# Kanap - E-commerce Website  

This project was developed as part of my studies at **OpenClassrooms**.  
The goal was to build an online store for **Kanap**, a furniture company that previously only sold its products in a physical shop.

## 📖 Project Overview  

The **Kanap e-commerce site** allows customers to:  
- Browse available products on the homepage.  
- View detailed information for each product on a dedicated page.  
- Add products to a shopping cart and manage their order.  
- Confirm their purchase with an order confirmation page.  

This project focused on **JavaScript development** by connecting a static front-end to a back-end API and dynamically displaying content.
